# Learn-Python
Author-shreyas

This project is a simple, command-line-based quiz game inspired by the popular Indian TV show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC). The objective is to answer a series of multiple-choice questions correctly. Each correct answer increases the player's prize, and a wrong answer ends the game with the last secured prize amount.

*Main Features*
Multiple Choice Questions: The player is presented with a series of questions, each having four answer options.

Prize Ladder: With each correct answer, the in-game prize money increases. The objective is to answer as many questions as possible to maximize winnings.

Simple User Interaction: The game operates entirely via the Python command line. Players input their answer choices and receive immediate feedback on correct or incorrect responses.

Game End Condition: The game stops after a wrong answer, displaying the total prize earned so far.

No Lifelines: The game does not offer any lifelines such as 50-50, audience poll, flip the question, or double dip.

No Additional Libraries: The project does not use matplotlib, Tkinter, or other enhancement libraries; it is built only with core Python.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Platform: Console/terminal application

Libraries: Standard Python (no third-party modules required).

Basic Algorithm
Store a list of questions, each with four options and one correct answer.

Iterate through the questions, displaying one at a time to the player.

Accept user input for answer selection.

Check the user’s answer: if correct, increase prize and continue; if incorrect, end the game and show prize earned.

This project is a straightforward, beginner-friendly way to practice Python basics such as input/output, loops, conditional statements, and data structure handling—all while enjoying a quiz-game experience.
